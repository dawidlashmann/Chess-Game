# Chess-Game
### Fully functional chess game with a basic chess engine.

## About
This project was aiming to reconstruct chess game as it is played on *[chess.com](https://www.chess.com)*. 

It first started as a console game, but later on I decided to implement a GUI, which is written in `SFML`.

Based on the `game` functions used in a 2 player game, a simple chess engine was then added. It was later on, that it was enhanced with basic function to evaluate the current and future positions. 
Despite this engine not being "smart", it has some logic behind it, and it's development will be continued.

## Usability
The game is 100% playable, with some rules missing (the most important being en passant).

PvP mode (or PvE), can be chosen inside `main.cpp`.

## GUI
The GUI is shown below, with the piece's icons as well as tiles modifiable, by uploading an image to chess directory.
