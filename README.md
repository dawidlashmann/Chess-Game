# Chess-Game
Fully functional chess game with a basic chess engine

The game itself is a fully functional chess game, intended to work just like on chess.com
It is worth noting, that en passant is not implemented yet, but everything besides that works just like on chess.com

The chess engine currently functions as a random legal move generator, but I am planning on advancing it in the future with various algorithms
Additionaly I am planning on build a GUI using SFML/OpenGL

The code is strictly OOP as I wanted to better myself in it.

If you used my code and found any bugs, or have genereal tips on how to better it, please let me know any way possible!
