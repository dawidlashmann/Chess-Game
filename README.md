# Chess-Game
Fully functional chess game with a basic chess engine.

The game itself is a fully functional chess game, intended to work just like the game on chess.com.
It is worth noting, that en passant is not implemented yet, but everything besides that should work just fine.

The chess engine currently functions as a random, legal move generator, but I am planning on advancing it in the future with various algorithms.
Additionaly I am planning on build a GUI using SFML/OpenGL.

The code is strictly OOP as I wanted to better myself in it.

Please note that the chess engine code is not yet commented, so it may confuse some readers.

If you used my code and found any bugs, or have genereal tips on how to better it, please let me know any way possible!
